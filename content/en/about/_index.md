The main outcome of the project is the book *Construction Toys and Modern European Culture: Education, Politics, and Technology, 1830 to 1940* (forthcoming, Routledge, 2025). The website is a visualisation of the book and was created by Artemis Yagou in 2025, while a Scholar in Residence at the Deutsches Museum.
