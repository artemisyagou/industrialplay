{{< figure src="/img/AnkerRacism.jpg" >}}

Visual representations in toy catalogues and manuals underpinned a certain familiarisation with foreign cultures, but also perpetuated stereotypes. Occasionally, foreign features were incorporated in an insensitive or outright racist manner, as evident for example in an advertisement of the Anker-Richter firm. The text of the advertisement is shown as a poster next to which an African boy is standing. The boy is dressed in rags and looks at the poster with an expression of puzzlement and incomprehension. The image implicitly suggests Western intellectual superiority.
