{{< figure src="/img/AnkerStructure.jpg" >}}

The container and packaging of construction sets, where all the pieces could be arranged and stored following a specific packing plan, especially promoted the idea of order and structure, and encouraged the young minds to recognise multiplicity in unity. This was an innovative concept systematically introduced by Fr√∂bel's Gifts; bricks were stored and presented to children in a way that determined how they had to be used. *Anker-Richter* also promoted specific packing arrangements that highlighted the blocks of a set as a harmonious unity composed of multiple elements.
