The *Dandanah* is a *sui generis* construction set created in the early 1920s, following the carnage and devastation of the First World War. Although it was supposed to be a toy for children, it is in fact rather unsuitable for play, since it consists of little bricks made of colourful glass. The rationale behind its creation involved a mixture of beliefs related to light and colour, technology, and the materiality of glass, as well as unrealistic visions of an ideal world. Ultimately, the *Dandanah* was a miniature utopia, an idiosyncratic adult experiment driven by the anxieties and hopes of Modernity.
