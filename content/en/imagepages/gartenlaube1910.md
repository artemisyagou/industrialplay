A major innovation introduced by the firm *Anker-Richter*, was the practice of ‘Series’, through which the child user could accumulate blocks incrementally, by buying a simple and cheap set to begin with and complement it gradually. Toy manufacturers encouraged children to save money in order to be able to regularly buy new supplements and continue adding to their collection. The Series system enabled even children of limited financial means to acquire these relatively expensive toys and participate in the community of players. Additionally, and more importantly, through the Series system, manufacturers endorsed thrift, patience, and persistence as major assets. They educated children users into a logic of anticipation and step-by-step progress, and ‘drilled’ them in the ways and pleasures of modern consumption.
