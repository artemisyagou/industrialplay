In the Soviet Union, the disciplined child, as opposed to the ‘wild’ and ‘dangerous’ one, served as an agent of a luminous, utopian Soviet future, a future that would be homogeneous, prosperous, and modern at the same time. Obedient and uniformly behaving children conformed to the ideals of a standardised, industrial society. Building blocks were used as a model and metaphor for building this new society through engineering expertise and hard work. Childhood was a social construct; play-related iconography from the Soviet Union illustrates the ways adults co-opted children according to the dominant Communist paradigm. Nina Sakonskaia’s book *Mamin Most* (Mother’s Bridge), published in 1933, is an illuminating example of how construction toys were embedded in political narratives. The woman ‘hero’ of this book is an engineer who works to design a bridge. Her little girl is shown sitting on the floor beside her, playing with building blocks. As the mother is busy creating a complicated, innovative technical structure, so is the girl absorbed in building something new on the small scale.
